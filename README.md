# OSINTCart

OSINTCart is built on [simpleStore](http://chrisdiana.github.io/simplestore), a clean, responsive
storefront boilerplate with no database you can setup in minutes. simpleStore uses
[simpleCart.js](http://simplecartjs.org) and [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com)
CSS Framework for a lightweight, fast, simple to use, and completely
customizable experience.

### A note about JavaScript shopping carts

ALL JavaScript shopping carts are NOT fullproof. Because simpleStore is fully
client-side, some users may attempt to alter prices before checkout.
SimpleStore does the best it can to minimize this
kind of activity. Make sure to monitor your sales. Just like in real life, if someone
walks into your store and changes the price tag, you will certainly not honor
those changes.
